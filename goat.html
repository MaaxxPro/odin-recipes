    <h1><em>Tomato and Goat Cheese Dip</em></h1>
    <p>This is my variation on a goat cheese dip I found. I tinkered a little with the herbs and savories from the original.
    This dip is excellent for parties, and has always been a huge hit. It's great on crosstini, pretzels, chips, and also goes great smeared in a sandwich.</p>
