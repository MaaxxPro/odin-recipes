    <h1><em>Easy Ad Hoc "Baristamisu"</em></h1>

    <p>In the cafe I work at, we sell madeleine cookies in packs of three, and sometimes one or two breaks inside the packaging.
        We can't sell this damaged merchandise, but it's still perfectly fine for making Barista-misu, and it only calls for three ingredients.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Madeleine cookies</li>
            <li>Espresso</li>
            <li>Whipped Cream</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How it Do</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a madeleine cookie in a demitasse, or other small cup (about 6 oz)</li>
            <li>Pull 2 shots of espresso directly onto the cookie, and make sure the cookie is soaking in the espresso (smush it down or break it if you have to)</li>
            <li>Top with whipped cream and refrigerate at least one hour</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
    
    <p>It really is that easy, and the result is a slightly bitterwseet, soft, tasty little confection that you won't be able to get enough of!
        Be careful though, as the espresso shots are full strength, and you will get a buzz off even just one.
        You can adjust the results by changing the number of shots, or adjusting the length of the pull.
        Try a shorter pull for a brighter, less bitter end result!
        And if you're asking your local cafe's barista to make for you, don't forget to tip handsomely.
