    <h1><em>Roasted Tomatillo Chili</em></h1>
    <p>This recipe is based on one I got from a friend, who got it from a friend.
        It's proven quite tasty numerous times, and I'm constantly tweaking the recipe.
        My main addition has been the bonanza of chilis which bring flavor and make it muy picante!
        This recipe is very versatile, and I welcome you to make any changes you'd like.

        </ul>
    <h2>How it do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread the diced tomatillos on a baking sheet, season with salt and pepper, and drizzle with olive oil</li>
            <li>broil the tomatillos on high, flipping them with a spatula to prevent burning, until roasted and soft</li>
            <li>While the tomatillos are cooking, in a large pot or Dutch Oven, add a drizzle of olive oil and haet on medium high</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, add the white scallion bottoms and onions, season with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Stir until the onions become soft, then add the meat and increase heat to medium-high, season with salt, pepper, and chili seasoning</li>
            <li>Stir the meat making sure to break up any chunks <em>if the pot becomes dry, add more oil</em></li>
            <li>When the meat start to brown, add garlic and tomatillos</li>
            <li>Continue to stir a couple minutes, scraping up any fond from the bottom, then add both cans of tomatoes (and beans if you're including them)</li>
            <li>Continue to stir as you bring the contents to a simmer, then reduce heat</li>
            <li>Add peppers, season with salt and pepper, add adobo sauce to taste, and a dash or two of worcestershire (or soy sauce or fish sauce)</li>
            <li>Allow to simmer at least one hour, stirring occasionally</li>
            <li>Mix in cilantro to taste (or parsley if you don't like cilantro)</li>
            <li>Serve with a garnish of green scallion tops and cilantro, and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
    <p>There you have it! This chili is great the longer you simmer, and is great with some Mexican cheese blend, sour cream, and/or greek yogurt!
