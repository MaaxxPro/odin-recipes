Recipes site for Odin html lessons
The assignment is to create a functioning website for recipes, from scratch, using the skills I've learned in html, git, and with the command line. This will demonstrate command of basic html syntax and commands, as well as website architecture. The implementation will demonstrate command of the use of CLI and Bash. And utilizing git in the process will require me to familiarize myself with the standard through practice.
